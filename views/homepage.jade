			div.header What is Time Trakr ?
		p.
			Time Trakr is the tiny productivity app that doesn't get in your way.
			It has just the features you need, and doesn't have the features you don't!<br/>
			It works by tracking time of the tasks you're working on, and displaying the list
			for you to see how much time was spent on each task.<br/>
			Just type in a task and hit 'enter'. Then, start and stop the task whenever you want
			until you mark it 'done'.

	div(class='container more-info')
		div.header What's in the free version of Time Trakr ?
		p.
			You get the full working app to try and play with as much as you want.
			After a while you might (which means you will) start getting annoying
			popups suggesting you buy the product.<br/>
			If you have nerves of steal you will still be able to use the program freely.

		div.header Why should I buy Time Trakr ?
		p.
			I don't belong to a big organization trying to capitalize on the backs' of others.<br/>
			I'm just trying to be a productive programmer (hence this program I built) building
			some cool programs for fun, and	letting others enjoy my work in the process as well.
			If you think your work should be valued, then please try to value mine by chipping
			in a bit and buying it.<br/>
			I tried to put an reasonable price on this program - If you think it's wrong, then please
			feel free to contact me so we can reach an agreement. :)<br/>
			<br/>
			By purchasing this program you will get free updates to all newer versions if and
			whenever released. I will also answer all support emails and sincerely work hard to
			fix any bugs, if ever discovered. 

	div(class='container more-info')
		div.header Will there be any updates ?
		p.
			I am planning on updating the app, and adding some cool features. For that to happen
			I will likely need some people to support my work by purchasing the app.<br/>
			My plans for future features include :<br/>
			 - Saving history of all stats in local archive.<br/>
			 - Viewing stats on historic tasks, including deleted ones.<br/>
			 - Customizing colors, fonts and font sizes to match your style.<br/>
			 - Adding keyboard shortcuts.<br/>
			 - Mobile app!<br/>
			 - Support for other platforms<br/>
			 - and much, much more...<br/>
